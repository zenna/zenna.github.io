I am an associate research scientist and [Alan Kanzer Innovation Fellow](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/innovation-scholar-zenna-tavares-wants-give-machines-common-sense) at the Zuckerman Institute and Data Science Institute of Columbia University.  I came to Columbia from a postdoc position working for [Armando Solar Lezama](http://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/) and with the [Computational Cognitive Science group](http://cocosci.mit.edu) run by [Joshua Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html).  I completed my Ph.D in the same group.

I am from London. I have two big brothers: [Kibwe](http://blog.ted.com/constructing-kinetic-worlds-the-futuristic-films-of-ted-fellow-kibwe-tavares/) who cofounded architecture/animation studio [Factory Fifteen](http://www.factoryfifteen.com/) and musician/designer/artist [Gaika](https://warp.net/artists/gaika/).

# What do I do

I work to understand and mechanize the various forms of human reasoning.  This primarily consists of developing algorithms and languages for (Bayesian) probabilistic modeling and causal inference.  I use a variety of tools in programming languages and analysis, statistics, and (deep!) machine learning.  I like to design little programming languages that synthesize these ideas, such as [Omega.jl](https://github.com/zenna/Omega.jl).

# What do I do (with less the mumbo jumbo)

I have two goals. First, is to understand how humans reason, which is to say, how they come to derive knowledge from observing and interacting with the world.  Second, I aim to construct tools that advance science, engineering and (hopefully) the humanities.  Perhaps surprisingly, there is a sizable chunk of fertile ground that allows me to do both more or less simultaneously.
