I am a postdoctoral researcher working for [Armando Solar Lezama](http://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/), and am associated with the [Computational Cognitive Science group](http://cocosci.mit.edu) run by [Joshua Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html).  I recently completed my Ph.D in the same group.

I am from London. I have two big brothers: [Kibwe](http://blog.ted.com/constructing-kinetic-worlds-the-futuristic-films-of-ted-fellow-kibwe-tavares/) who cofounded architecture/animation studio [Factory Fifteen](http://www.factoryfifteen.com/) and musician/designer/artist [Gaika](https://warp.net/artists/gaika/).

# What do I do
I work primarily at the intersection of Bayesian probabilistic modeling, causal reasoning, machine learning, and programming languages.
I like to design little programming languages that synthesize these ideas, such as [Omega.jl](https://github.com/zenna/Omega.jl).

I am generally interested in how to represent knowledge about the world, in all its complexity and uncertainty, and how to efficiently derive conclusions and inferences from such knowledge.
