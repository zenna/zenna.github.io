If you're interested in collaborating on research projects, please reach out.
Also, I'm hiring:

# Research Software Engineer

We're looking for a research software engineer eager to work in an academic environment at the cutting edge of probabilistic programming, causal inference, program synthesis and machine learning.

### __Role:__

You will play an integral part in developing systems for automatic causal and probabilistic inference. Our goal is to build systems that can reason coherently about the real world, in all of its complexity and ambiguity. These systems should allow people to (semi-automatically) build sophisticated models of the world, determine causal effects, design experiments, and construct explanations. An immediate application is in algorithmic fairness.

### __Relevant areas:__
- Probabilistic programming
- Causal inference - Machine learning
- Program synthesis
- Program analysis
- Automated theorem proving
Youâ€™ll work with me and the DSI community.

### __Responsibilities:__
- Programming language design/implementation
- Performance engineering, scaling research code
- Algorithm development
- Application to real-world problems

### __Preferred Qualifications:__
- Strong coding ability. esp. Julia, Python, C++, ML-family
- Comfortable digesting research e.g. from PLDI, POPL, NeurIPS or ICML
- Good software engineering practices
- Able to progress with high degree of autonomy, and under uncertainty

To apply, please write to <zt2297@columbia.edu> and/or apply directly at [https://apply.interfolio.com/91828](https://apply.interfolio.com/91828)

# (PT) Research Assistant
I'm looking for a talented part-time research assistant.

This position is ideal for someone eager to get involved in an exciting research environment on some of the most exciting research topics.

You'll work largely with me but will be part of broader research at Columbia, specifically the Zuckerman Brain Mind Behaviour Institute and the Data Science Institute.

### __Role:__
Your time will be split between helping existing research within the group, pursuing your own research, helping to write grant proposals, and various kinds of administrative work.

### __Preferred Qualifications:__
I will consider all candidates, but the larger the subset of the following, the better.

- Strong writing ability, especially in synthesizing and explaining technical topics
- Fast and efficient writing and editing ability
- Comfortable digesting academic research papers
- Interest or have done work in  probabilistic programming, causal inference, program synthesis and machine learning or related areas
- Technical expertise, broadly in mathematics and programming.
- Able to progress with high degree of autonomy, and under uncertainty

To apply, please write to <zt2297@columbia.edu>
